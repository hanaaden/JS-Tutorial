# Arrays 

array is like a box that can hold many things 

let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"];

In JavaScript, an array is an ordered list of values. 
You can call values into elements 
We assign this value into numeric positions we call index 

In example above apple position is index 0 

So indexing starts in 0

Arrays can hold any type of data-such as numbers, strings, objects, or even other arrays

Assess the array

Any element in the array can be accessed using the index number. The index in the arrays starts with 0.

```js
console.log(fruits[0]); // "apple"
console.log(fruits[2]); // "mango"
```

Replace 

You can replace an item by accessing it using its index:
```bash
fruits[1] = "orange";
console.log(fruits); // ["apple", "orange", "mango"]
```
